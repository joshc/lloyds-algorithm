# Lloyd's algorithm

This is an implementation of Lloyd's algorithm (also commonly known as K-means clustering) in MATLAB, run on a fabricated data set of points randomly chosen from the uniform data set X = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]. Cluster centers are initialized at random from the fabricated data set. It includes parameters to choose K (number of clusters) and N (number of data points), and a depiction of Lloyd's algorithm. Please refer to the program files for more information.

## Instructions to run:

1. Download all of the files here into a directory in the MATLAB path.
2. Run 'lloyds_anim.m' in MATLAB.
3. Input chosen values for K and N (default values provided).
